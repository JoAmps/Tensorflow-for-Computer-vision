## Fashion recommendation system based on images
When shopping online, users click on an image and are shown similar images in case they want to check those out next. This reduces the stress for the customers to manually type the name and find similar product images, it also keeps the customers hooked at the site and very likley make a purchase and come back next time. I used a database of 1,639 fashion images ranging from shoes to bags,wallets to perfumes, socks to shirts and many more. Though the resoulutions of the image wasnt that great. An individual can select an image, and would be shown the next 5 most similar items. I used a cosine similarity score to compute the similarity of images, which works very well. I used the mobile net V2 architecture, and took off the last layer(used for predictions),so we retrieve all the information that the model obtained. The model works very well in recommending similar products, i tested this model using real world images(high quality images), and it performed very well in recommending similar items in the database of low quality images.
