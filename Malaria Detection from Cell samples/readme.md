# Detect malaria parasites from cell samples and deploy using Anvil
## Malaria remains a major burden on global health, with roughly 200 million cases worldwide and more than 400,000 deaths per year.One of the barriers toward a successful mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. This model can help clinicians get a better and faster and accurate diagnoses of malaria to save lives.
### I built the model from scratch without any transfer learning to detect malaria parasites from cell samples and deployed using the Anvil app
### The model achieves an accuracy of 88.06% for 50 epochs on the test data. Its a very small dataset but the images were augmented to reduce overfitting and also to create more training samples for the model to learn and generalize better. The deployed model can be accessed from this webpage here https://malariadetect.anvil.app/
